/**
 * Supabase Usage Check Helper
 * 
 * This file provides guidance on checking Supabase cached egress usage.
 * 
 * To check your usage:
 * 1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}/usage
 * 2. Look for "Cached Egress" metric
 * 3. Review daily usage graphs to identify spikes
 * 
 * To get your PROJECT_ID:
 * - Check your NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL environment variable
 * - It's the subdomain before .supabase.co
 * - Example: https://abcdefgh.supabase.co → PROJECT_ID is "abcdefgh"
 * 
 * Or use Supabase MCP tools in Cursor to check usage programmatically.
